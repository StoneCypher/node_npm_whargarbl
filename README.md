# node_npm_whargarbl
This is a trivial stub module containing a function which returns the string 'whargarbl'.

## ... why?
This is mostly useful to see whether modules are making it through a packaging system.  If you've ever juggled multiple incompatible packaging systems at once (I'm looking at you two, Angular with Browserify,) then you're probably sympathetic to the need to see what's going where.

You very likely do not want or need this.

`node_npm_whargarbl` is MIT licensed, because viral licenses and newspeak language modification are evil. Free is only free when it's free for everyone.
